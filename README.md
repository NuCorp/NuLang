# ðŸ¦„ Nu programming language ðŸ¦„
---
I want to make a programming language that perfectly suits my wishes. I come from C++ world then I desover and love Go, but still, there are some things that I would do differently.
That's why I am doing my own programming language, and who knows, it may be liked by others !

Nu lang should be compilable and interpretable so we can make the development more easy and still have compiled executable for performance.
I attend to design it for safety; It will still be possible to make unsafety code, but we shouldn't be able to hide it.
That language should also be easy to read/write and will use comment to play with compiler/interpreter warning messages.

The syntax is close to Go and Swift.
